## Overview
This project implements a user login system using Laravel. It features user registration, authentication, and invitation functionalities. The codebase is organized with repositories, services, DTOs, and actions to promote clean architecture and separation of concerns. API routes are defined for user-related operations, and unit tests are provided to ensure reliability. The system is designed for extensibility and maintainability, following best practices in modern PHP development.
